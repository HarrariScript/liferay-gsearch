# Installation Instructions

First, download the application binaries for your portal version. You can find detailed compatibility information in each distribution folder.

If you choose to use the custom Elasticsearch adapter (recommended), find the binaries and instructions for your portal version in folder "custom-elasticsearch-adapter". 

If you'd like to have custom adapter for a portal version not currently available, please leave a ticket.
